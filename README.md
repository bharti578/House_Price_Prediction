# House_Price_Prediction
House Price Prediction Project

Overview

This project uses machine learning to predict the price of a house based on its features such as area, number of bedrooms, and age. The project utilizes Python libraries including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.

Features

- Area: Square footage or size of the house
- Bedrooms: Number of bedrooms in the house
- Age: Age of the house in years

Target Variable

- Price: Predicted price of the house

Libraries Used

- NumPy: For numerical computations
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
- Matplotlib: For data visualization
- Seaborn: For data visualization
- Scikit-learn: For machine learning

Project Structure

- data: Directory containing the dataset
- models: Directory containing the trained models
- notebooks: Directory containing Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model training
- src: Directory containing Python scripts for data preprocessing and model training

Future Work

- Feature engineering: Explore additional features that can improve model performance
- Hyperparameter tuning: Optimize model hyperparameters for better performance
